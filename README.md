## Tasks
- Code structure
- Code repository
 - https://github.com/noahgarfinkle/WaterDataProcessing
- Organize data
 - "Profile" data- what columns does it have?  What transformations are required
 - Way to store data so we can all work on it without it being tied to the code repository
   - CorpsNet or RDE?
   - Data manager to let us sync up data?
- Organize models
 - What are their data needs?
   - Structure
   - Units

### By next week
- Organization system for data
- Code repository set up on all computers
- Library list in code repository
